# hello-world
a place to store ideas, resorces and to share and discuss things with others

I'm currently enrolled in a Data Science certification program through Johns Hopkins. For ten years, I've taught math, English and I've started a small business called Compensation Solutions, LLC with my wife. We create compensation structures and job descriptions for small and large companies whom may not have enough compensation analysts to design and implement a compensation program. The type of data that I work with is considered small structured data. The reason why I'm intereseted in the Johns Hopkins Data Science certification program is to learn how to work with large and unstructured data.

Comment message about my changes: The above paragraph is a small bio describing what I do now and my interest within Data Science.
